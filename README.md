# FU Social Media Project

A simple social media web application built for Foundation University.  
This project demonstrates core features of a social media platform such as posting, liking, and commenting — **without a messaging feature**.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **PHP** – backend logic & server-side processing  
- **AJAX** – asynchronous requests (smooth, no page reloads)  
- **JavaScript** – client-side interactivity  
- **CSS** – styling and layout  

## ✨ Features
- User authentication (signup/login/logout)  
- Create, edit, and delete posts  
- Like and comment functionality  
- Responsive design with CSS  
- AJAX-powered interactions for better user experience  

## 🚫 Not Included
- Messaging / chat feature (intentionally left out for this version)  

## 📌 Future Improvements
Add private messaging feature
Notifications system
